## About Me
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a dedicated student at [42 Florence School](https://42firenze.it/), where I'm immersing myself in the fascinating world of coding and technology. My journey in programming began with a simple curiosity about how software shapes our world, and this curiosity has blossomed into a full-blown passion.

I am particularly intrigued by the challenges of problem-solving and the satisfaction of creating something from nothing but code. My experience at 42 Florence has not only taught me about various programming languages and technologies but has also honed my skills in critical thinking, collaboration, and self-learning.

In my projects, I strive to combine functionality with creativity, aiming to build applications that are not only efficient but also user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Whether it's delving into algorithms, experimenting with new frameworks, or collaborating on diverse team projects, I embrace every aspect of the learning process.

I believe that the field of technology is a playground of endless possibilities, and I am eager to explore every corner of it. I am particularly excited about the potential of AI and machine learning and look forward to integrating these technologies into my future projects.

## My Projects
Here are some projects I've worked on that I'm really proud of:

- **Minitalk**: It allows a client and a server to exchange messages using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals. [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Muddrayss/minitalk)
- **Fract-ol**: Creating graphically beautiful fractals [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/Muddrayss/fract-ol)
